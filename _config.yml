# Developer's Note: This is a sample _config.yml file offered with
# jekyll-theme-prologue for your convenience. To use it, move it to your
# project's root directory. Please note that the following lines are
# NECESSARY for Prologue to work correctly:
#
# theme: jekyll-theme-prologue
# collections: [sections]
#
# They activate the theme and tell Jekyll to find your homepage content
# in /_sections. Note where "sections" starts with an underscore
# and where it doesn't. The social settings will make links to
# Twitter, etc., but only if you give the URL.
#
# Also, be sure to customize url and baseurl for your site.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  내가 잠시나마 인간의 속절없는 슬픔과 숨가쁜 환희에 흥미를 잃어버렸던 것은
  개츠비를 희생물 삼은 것들, 개츠비의 꿈이 지나간 자리에 떠도는
  더러운 먼지들 때문이었다.
